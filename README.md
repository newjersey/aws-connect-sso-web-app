# AWS Connect SSO Web App

This project is intended to run from AWS Amplify, using Cognito as the log in
mechanism with users configured to have specialized groups representing their
Call Center permissions for various AWS Connect instances. This works in concert
with the Lambda defined for
[generating SAML Responses for Connect](https://github.com/newjersey/custom-aws-idp).

TODO fill in the rest.
